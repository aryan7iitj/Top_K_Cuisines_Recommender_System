# Top-K Cuisines Recommender System

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based implementation of a Top-K Cuisines Recommender System. The system recommends the top K cuisines to a user based on their profile, body attributes, location, and previous cuisine preferences. Recommendations are generated by combining multiple similarity measures, including Jaccard similarity and Manhattan distance.

## Files

- `Top_K_Cuisines_Recommender_System.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file implementing the recommender system.
- `userprofile.csv`: A CSV file containing user profile data with columns such as `userID`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `weight`, `height`, and `birth_year`.
- `usercuisine.csv`: A CSV file containing user cuisine preferences with columns `userID` and `Rcuisine`.

## Working Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Loading Data:** The notebook begins by loading user profile and cuisine preference data from CSV files.
- **Cleaning Data:** The user profile data is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns (`latitude`, `longitude`, `weight`, `height`, `birth_year`) and replacing missing values (`?`) with the mode of the respective column.

### 2. Similarity Calculations

- **Jaccard Similarity:**
  - **Definition:** Measures the similarity between two sets by computing the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union.
  - **Application:** Used to calculate similarity based on categorical user profile attributes and cuisine preferences.
  
- **Manhattan Distance:**
  - **Definition:** Measures the distance between two points in a grid-based system, calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
  - **Application:** Used to compute similarity based on numerical attributes like body measurements and location.

### 3. Similarity Matrices

- **User Profile Similarity Matrix:**
  - Constructed using Jaccard similarity for categorical attributes of user profiles.
  
- **Body Attribute Similarity Matrix:**
  - Constructed using Manhattan distance for body measurements (weight, height).

- **Location Similarity Matrix:**
  - Constructed using Manhattan distance for location coordinates (latitude, longitude).

- **Cuisine Preference Similarity Matrix:**
  - Calculated using Jaccard similarity for the set of cuisines preferred by users.

### 4. Weighted Similarity Aggregation

- **Combining Similarities:**
  - Various similarity matrices are combined using specified weights to form a single comprehensive user similarity matrix.
  - Weights are assigned as follows: `pf_w` (profile), `cui_w` (cuisine), `loc_w` (location), and `bod_w` (body attributes).

### 5. Top-K Cuisines Recommendation

- **Recommendation Process:**
  - Identifies users similar to the target user based on the aggregated similarity matrix.
  - Aggregates cuisine preferences of similar users to recommend the top K cuisines.

- **Example Usage:**
  - For a given `user_id`, the system finds similar users and recommends the top K cuisines that are most preferred by these similar users.

## Example

To get recommendations for a user, replace `user_id_to_recommend` with the target user ID and run the following code snippet:

```python
user_id_to_recommend = 'U1016'  # Replace with the user ID you want to recommend cuisines for
top_k_cuisines = get_top_k_cuisines_for_user(user_id_to_recommend, k=5)
print(f"Top-K cuisines for user {user_id_to_recommend}:")
print(top_k_cuisines)
